# ILP-Intro
Skills training material for an introduction to Integer Linear Programming with R &amp; Gurobi

This repository contains material for a one-hour skills training session on using Gurobi with R to solve Integer Linear Programming problems, with a special emphasis on spatial conservation planning problems.

Covers the following:
* Motivation for using ILP
* Code example for solving a spatial conservation planning problem
* Adding connectivity objectives
* Improving performance with linear relaxation of ILP problems

The scripts contained in this repository:
* ilp-intro-slides.Rpres : the R Presentation document that can be used to compile a HTML presentation with live R code
* ilp-intro-functions.R  : functions that are used to create spatially-correlated data and spatial weights matrices (representing spatial neighbours)
